##slice
ii[0,2] - 0 here is starting index - it is included in resulting slice. 2 - is last index, up to which result is generated. the 2nd index element is excluded from the resulting array.

So to cover full array 
ii[0:] or ii[0:len(ii)] can be used.

ii[0:0] , shall result in slice with no elements.
